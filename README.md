Some tools for Enter The Gungeon
I have ideas for a few diffent programs that would provide useful information while playing Enter the Gungeon. This is where I will track my progress and share my work.
Everything here is Free for non comercial use.

Gun List was my attempt to get a list of guns for use in other programs.

Junk Meter is my favorite, it tracks the junk you have and tells you relivant information.

and the ringtone I made myself straight from the games audio files, its in Iphone ringtone format.
